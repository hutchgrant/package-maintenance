* Impactful Projects Statusboard [#569](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/569)
  * nothing to discuss this week
  * Ben from OpenJS Foundation is talking about updating LFX Dashboard, does that relate?

  * Darcy not a lot of time to do work, so if people have time to jump in and help, please do!

    possibly merge. - Agreed to land - <https://github.com/pkgjs/create-pkg/pull/18>

* Proposal to group charter itself for ownership of the package manager space.
  * Has led to issues/disagreements going directly to TSC without a lot of discussion

  * Some discussion between Glenn and Dominykas to validate the approach/style that Glenn
    has started with
  * Dominykas, could use some diagrams. Has been a few times where they would have been
    good for explaining to people who are asking questions.

* Pavel, in terms of promotion might be good to write blog post update, maybe also a round
  table/public talk. To bring out discussion of drafts and current issues.
